#Welcome to Crosstown (unless I come up with a better name by the time I'm done fucking around in Phaser)

##Introduction
This game will be a procedurally generated open world game. The big difference between this game and others like it is that you can assume control of any entity in the game you with at any time. There is no overarching storyline, there are no cutscenes or invisible boundaries. The only restriction in this game is what you want to do. 

##Emergent Behaviors
Most of the gameplay will focus on emergent behavior. The actual ruleset of the game will be incredibly sparse and AI entities must have a fairly high degree of autonomy. Essentially, the goal is to enable the player to do literally whatever they want in this game. You want to turn your starting entity's neighborhood into a slum? Join a gang, take it over, and start slinging drugs like crazy. Want to be mayor of a metropolis? Go to law school, get into politics, and run a campaign. 

##Aim Big, Scale Back
I'm shooting for Mars here. If I ened up on the moon I'll be ecstatic.
